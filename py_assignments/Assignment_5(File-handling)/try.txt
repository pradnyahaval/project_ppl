Div-1, Batch-S2
1) Pradnya Haval   (111803054) 
2) Shubhangi Khedkar (111803062)
3.	Reason for selecting problem:
Every day while entering in the hostel wardens need to check the college ids of students. But, sometimes it gets really difficult for them to identify the hostellers and non-hostellers. So we decided to design an app to help their task.

4.	Current state of art to solve the problem:
Hostel wardens just check the ID cards (combo card).  It is to conform that student does belong to hostel or not. 

5.	Our solution:
The app will give information about students’ name, branch, cgpa, hostel block, room number. Also, they can update the information if necessary.


6.	Technology used:
1) Python v3.8x
2) Sqlite3
3) PyQt5
	4) CSS

7.	Future Developments:
We hope to add a feature to store records of hostel fees, monthly mess bills and give its updates to students through emails.
